# Sudoku-Solver

A sudoku-solving algorithm combining simple solving techniques 
with a fully-comprehensive brute-force method. The solving is
made more efficient by sorting the best options before making
guesses.


Note: Much can be done to make this more efficient, but it
is fully comprehensive meaning it can solve any sudoku given 
enough time, even without having advanced solving techniques.
